And since death was in the way of our redemption, He desired to go through it out of His love for us. And thus He ascended upon the Cross that He may bear the punishment of our sins.

For our sake, He preferred suffering over joy, toil over rest, contempt over glory, and the Cross over the throne which is carried by the cherubim.

He consented to be tied by ropes that He may loose us from the bonds of our sins. He humbled Himself that He may lift us up. He hungered to satiate us, and thirsted to quench our thirst.

And He ascended upon the Cross naked that He might clothe us with the garment of His righteousness. And He opened His side by the spear that we might enter into Him and dwell in the throne of His grace, and that the blood might flow from His body that we might wash ourselves from our iniquities.

Indeed, He died and was buried in the tomb, then He arose that He might raise us from the death of sin, and give us life unto life eternal.

### Syrian Fraction for the Feasts of the Cross and Standard Days: Thus truly the Logos...

Thus truly the Logos of God suffered in the flesh, was slain, bowed on the Cross, and His soul parted from His body,

He was pierced with the spear in His side, out of which flowed blood and water for the forgiveness of the whole world; His body was smeared in them, and His soul came and was reunited with His body.

In place of sins which engulf the world, the Son died on the Cross and turned us from the way-of-life on the left to that on the right.

He made peace through the blood of His Cross, uniting and reconciling the heavenly with the earthly, the  people with the peoples, and the soul with the body.

And on the third day He rose from the tomb.

One is Immanuel, who is indivisible after the union, and undivided into two natures. Thus we believe, thus we confess, and thus we affirm that this Body belongs to this Blood, and this Blood belongs to this Body.
